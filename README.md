# STEMio website with chatbot integration

This project was created using a frontend powered by React and Javascript, as well as a backend powered by Express and Node.js. Additionally, heroku has been used to deploy the website. In order to use the emailing functionality, a .env file needs to be created. There is a .examplenv outlining the required arguments.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && cd frontend && npm install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies before running the project

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the backend and the frontend of the app in the development mode.

Open either [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser. (the route forwarding by the backend allows both ports to be valid)

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
