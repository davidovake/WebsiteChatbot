        How to overcome the imposter syndrome and help bridge the diversity gap
        in the technology
      </h2>
      <p>
        Have you recently started coding course and everything seemed easy in
        the beginning but now you’re in the middle of the course and you are
        wondering if you are capable of finishing it or is coding for you or
        you’re feeling demotivated to work because you got lost somewhere
        between lines of code? – You are probably experiencing the imposter
        syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The imposter syndrome can be defined as the feel of not belonging where
        you are due to your abilities or doubting constantly your abilities. The
        diversity gap in the technology is not a myth and its one of the hot
        topics nowadays as many people are working towards closing that gap. The
        technology industry is male dominated and women are often doubting if
        they are in the right place or if they are performing well on their
        jobs. Many research papers are showing that men are finding their
        passion for technology in early age while women are normally discovering
        their interest at late age. The findings are stating that men are
        playing games which is helping them to improve their problem solving and
        analytical skills while women on the other hand are focusing more on art
        and creative thinking.

        I have experienced the imposter syndrome while I was doing MSc in
        Computer Science and I almost dropped out from the course but luckily I
        had someone to taught me out of it and to ensure me struggling is the
        process of learning. It is important to share your struggles as most
        likely you are struggling with the same where most of the people
        struggled when started learning how to code. ( Yes, I am talking about
        the Data Structures and Algorithms ). Learning how to code takes time
        and takes many failures but what is important is to learn from your
        mistakes. There are more and more women entering the technical world and
        sharing their learning stories that can inspire you. To make sure you
        are on the right track you can create a coding journal where you can
        record your progress and set goals to achieve.
