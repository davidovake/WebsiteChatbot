        <h1>What is Front End?</h1>
        <p>
          Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is
          the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or
          Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
          directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that
          the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website
          change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of
          how the field is developing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users
          open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to
          read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users
          now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and
          resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these
          aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site
          comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different
          operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices
          (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the
          developer.(

          <li>
            <h2>Learn CSS, Javascript and HTML</h2>
            <p>

              <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/programming-tutorial/best-front-end-programming-languages">
                coding languages
              </a>{" "}
              are the essential building blocks for web and app development, so
              you need to learn them. Fortunately, it’s not a very difficult
              undertaking. There are lots of online resources available out
              there that can help further your education in the coding
              languages. For extra credit, familiarize yourself with jQuery and
              JavaScript Frameworks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Get informed</h2>
            <p>
              That means reading articles and books about front end development.
              By getting an understanding of how things work on a website, you
              can make better sense of the various coding languages. If you want
              to round out your learning experience, check out some videos on
              YouTube.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Practice</h2>
            <p>
              Here’s where the old saying “practice makes perfect” comes into
              play. Start small by using your newfound knowledge to build small
              parts of a user interface, then expand slowly. If you end up
              making mistakes, don’t worry. Sometimes we learn more from our
              errors than we do from a flawless performance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Learn the Command Line</h2>
            <p>
              When pursuing a profession that has anything to do with web
              design, it’s a good idea to get at least a basic grasp of concepts
              like displaying files and file system navigation. On a related
              note, you should familiarize yourself with the properties of the
              Shell, which is the means of accessing operating system functions
              via a text interface.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Learn Version Control</h2>
            <p>
              One of the hazards of coding is having it break when you change
              one small thing. Even after you try to rectify the problem, things
              are never quite the same again. That’s why a good front end
              developer learns version control. There is an impressive selection
              of version control systems to choose from, but if you want to go
              with the most popular, go with Git.
            </p>

            <h2>Enhance your skills</h2>
            <p>
              Check out some tutorials, tools, and open-source projects.
              Resources such as freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Bootstrap, Vue.js, CSS
              Layout, and Front-end Checklist exist to help you master the
              skills of front end development without having to lay out any
              money for the opportunity. These tools are easily accessible
              online and can be a much-needed boost to your front end
              development education.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Take a course</h2>
            <p>
              Take a front end developer course. There’s nothing like learning
              from experienced people in a structured environment. You could do
              this by physically attending classes (which can be a drain on your
              free time), or taking an online course. There are many appropriate
              courses out there, but later on, we’ll show you an excellent and
              well-tested option that would perfectly fit your needs!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Get an internship</h2>
            <p>
              Become a junior front end developer. Sometimes, the best way to
              learn new skills is to work under more knowledgeable people, and
              that’s what a junior front end developer or an intern does. Of
              course, the pay is less, but you need fewer qualifications.
              Besides, you’ll be learning from more experienced people, and
              that’s always beneficial.(
